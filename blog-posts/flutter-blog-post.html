                    <p>Finally, it has arrived. Flutter V2.0!</p>
                    <p>It's really a major update, cause from now on, you're able to build apps for Android and iOS
                        <strong>and</strong> the web from a single codebase.</p>
                    <p>Yes, you heard right! Flutter for web has finally taken the step into stable release and
                        therefore recommended for production releases.</p>
                    <p>If that is not enough, they announced that Flutter for desktop has switched into beta. So,
                        everybody is now welcome to test and play around, to get a feeling how Flutter react on
                        desktop systems. Okay, there is a bunch of work left, but it's nice to see that they try to
                        get it to work.</p>
